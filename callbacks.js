Task 2: Temperature Checker 🌡️🌡️🌡️🌡️


You are creating a temperature monitoring system. Write a function called `checkTemperature` that:
1. Takes a temperature value and a callback function as arguments.
2. The callback function should evaluate whether the temperature is "Hot", "Warm", or "Cold" based on the following:
   - "Hot" if the temperature is above 30.
   - "Warm" if the temperature is between 15°C and 30.
   - "Cold" if the temperature is below 15.

Steps:
- Create the callback function to evaluate and log:
  - "[temperature]°C is Hot/Warm/Cold."

Example:
Input:
checkTemperature(35, theCallBackFunction);

Expected Output:
- "35°C is Hot."
- "22°C is Warm."
- "10°C is Cold."

STRETCH: Task 3: Quiz Evaluator 📚📚📚📚

You are building a quiz system. Write a function called `evaluateAnswer` that:
1. Takes a question, a correct answer, and a callback function as arguments.
2. The callback function should compare the user's answer with the correct answer and log whether the answer is correct or not.

Steps:
- Create the callback function to evaluate:
  - If the user's answer matches the correct answer, log: "Correct!"
  - Otherwise, log: "Incorrect. The correct answer is [correctAnswer]."

Example:
Input:
evaluateAnswer("What is 5 + 5?", "10", TheCallBackFunction);

Expected Output:
- If user's input is "10": "Correct!"
- If user's input is "15": "Incorrect. The correct answer is 10."
